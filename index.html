                                <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! For now, its main purpose is to serve as an information hub for my Live2D rigging commissions.</p>
                                <p>Eventually, I'll probably add a dev blog of sorts for projects I'm working on or have worked on in the past.</p>
                                <p>In that same vein, I should mention some things about me. I'm a developer, mainly; in the process of finishing up my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The focus of my studies in CS has leaned towards the creative side of things, given my end goal of being a game dev. I have a lot of personal experience in Unity development as well as some professional experience in full-stack web development.</p>
                                <p>Other than that, I try to build my other creative skills as well. I can do some half-decent digital art if I try really hard, some okay character design, 3D modelling, Live2D rigging (obviously), writing... I'm pretty useless when it comes to any kind of audio production, though. No idea how to make music at all. I should really get on that.</p>
                                <p>Anyway, if you're here to inquire about a rigging commission, feel free to check out the <a href="commissions/index.html">commissions page</a>! It should have most of what you need to know. If you're not here for that, I'm honestly not sure what you're here for right now. But, hey! Thanks for visiting. I hope you're having a good day.</p>
                                <p class="right">Stay safe! -typeou</p>
