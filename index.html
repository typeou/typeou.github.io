                    <p>Hello and welcome to my website! For now its main purpose is to serve as an information hub for my Live2D rigging commissions.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, it will probably have a dev blog of sorts for projects I'm working on or have worked on in the past.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>I'm a recent computer science graduate who concentrated their studies on the creative applications of programming.</p>
                        <p>As such, my primary skills are in programming and game development! I have a bunch of minor skills like 3D modelling and basic animation, but I'm still a novice at those.</p>
                        <p>I have a lot of personal experience in Unity development as well as some professional experience in full-stack web development using .NET.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes I make little tools like <a href="https://typeou.itch.io/kbonk">KBonk</a>, a viewer interaction tool for VTubers that allows their audience to throw stuff at them.</p>
                        <p>I've been working on on-and-off on a yet-unannounced project for the past few years. More information on that when it's done.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>Anyway, if you're here to inquire about a commission, feel free to check out the <a href="comms.html">commissions page</a>! It should have most of what you need to know. If you're here for help with KBonk, go <a href="kbonk.html">here</a>! If you're not here for either of those, I'm honestly not sure what you're here for right now. But, hey! Thanks for visiting. I hope you're having a good day.</p>
                    <p class="right">Stay safe! -typeou</p>
